# rn-hooksy

A lightweight, comprehensive collection of reusable React hooks for React Native — designed to handle common functionality, eliminate boilerplate, and boost developer productivity across iOS, Android, Windows, Web, and visionOS.

Whether you need async state management, timers, debouncing, history tracking, global state, or lifecycle utilities — `rn-hooksy` has you covered with battle-tested, well-typed hooks that work seamlessly in any React Native project.

---

## Installation

```sh
npm install rn-hooksy
```

or with Yarn:

```sh
yarn add rn-hooksy
```

### Peer Dependencies

To use all features of this library, you'll need to install the following peer dependencies:

```sh
npm install @react-native-clipboard/clipboard @react-native-community/netinfo
```

or with Yarn:

```sh
yarn add @react-native-clipboard/clipboard @react-native-community/netinfo
```

### Platform-Specific Setup

#### iOS

After installing the dependencies, navigate to the `ios` folder and install CocoaPods dependencies:

```sh
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

#### Android

For Android, the native dependencies will be auto-linked. If you're using React Native < 0.60, you may need to manually link the packages:

```sh
npx react-native link @react-native-clipboard/clipboard
npx react-native link @react-native-community/netinfo
```

For React Native 0.60+, no additional steps are required for Android — the dependencies will be linked automatically.

## Features

- 🔁 **Lifecycle hooks** — mount, unmount, update detection
- 📦 **State hooks** — counters, toggles, history, lists, sets, queues, maps
- ⏱️ **Timer hooks** — interval, timeout, debounce, throttle, RAF, countdown, stopwatch
- 🔀 **Async hooks** — loading/error/value states with retry support
- 🔄 **Reducer & Context factories** — shared state without Redux overhead
- ✅ **Validation hooks** — run validators reactively on state change
- ⚡ **Performance hooks** — memoization, render counting, RAF state, deep compare
- 📱 **Device hooks** — network, keyboard, dimensions, color scheme, permissions, clipboard
- 🛡️ **Safety hooks** — safe state, safe area insets, lock fn, mounted state
- 🌐 **Cross-platform** — works on iOS, Android, Windows, Web, and visionOS

## Usage

```js
import {
  useToggle,
  useCounter,
  useAsync,
  useDebounce,
  useInterval,
  createGlobalState,
} from 'rn-hooksy';

// Toggle between true/false
const [isVisible, toggle] = useToggle(false);

// Track a number with helpers
const [count, { inc, dec, reset }] = useCounter(0);

// Fetch data with loading/error/value state
const state = useAsync(async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return res.json();
}, []);

// Debounce a search input
const [query, setQuery] = React.useState('');
useDebounce(
  () => {
    console.log('Search:', query);
  },
  500,
  [query]
);

// Run something every second
useInterval(() => {
  console.log('tick');
}, 1000);

// Globally shared state — no provider needed
const useGlobalCount = createGlobalState(0);
const [globalCount, setGlobalCount] = useGlobalCount();
```
